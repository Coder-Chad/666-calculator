    <p>666 Calculator Version 1.2.0</p>
    <p>Latest update: Friday October 12th 2018</p>
    <p>I will now explain how this app works.</p>
    <p>The way it works is simple. It uses a find the "beast" formula that takes each letter 
        of the alphabet and gives it a numeric value like this. A=6, B=12, C=18 and so on to 
        the end of the alphabet. Using these values it looks at each word that you type or paste 
        into the text box and adds up its value to see if it adds up to the beast code of 666.</p>
    <p>The beast code of 666 comes from the Christian Bible in the book or chapter referenced as 
        Revelation 13:18 From the King James version it reads “Here is wisdom. Let him that hath 
        understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number 
        is Six hundred threescore and six.”</p>
    <p>So if you do a search using the default search code value of 666 and the default letter A 
        value of 6 you can search for the "beast code" with any text you type or paste into the 
        text box.</p>
    <p>The words "computer", "Kissinger", "Monsanto", "potatoes", "yuppies" and "pictures" are all 
        examples of words that add up to the beast code of 666.</p>
    <p>NOTE: If you paste in the english language which is more than 60,000 words you will find 
        hundreds of 666 "beast" matches for some very ordinary words.</p>
    <p>NOTE: If you select the "TWO WORD CALCULATION" menu option you can do a two word pattern 
        search throughout any text that you type or paste into the input text box. It will find any 
        two words that match the search code specified. The default search code is 666 and the 
        default value for the letter A is 6. So using the start page defaults the two words 
        "New York" or "Recep Erdogan" or "a President" will generate a match when the search is done.</p>
