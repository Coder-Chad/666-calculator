A calculator that looks at input text and calculates each word searching for a 666 or beast code match.

The So Called "Beast" Calculator Version 1.0.0

NOTE: This app is live at https://666-calculator.netlify.com/index.html

This is the text from the app's custom alert box that explains how this app works.

The way it works is simple. It uses a "find the beast formula" that
takes each letter of the alphabet and gives it a numeric value like 
this. A=6, B=12, C=18 and so on to the end of the alphabet. Using these 
values it looks at each word that you type or paste into the text box 
and adds up its value to see if it adds up to the "beast" code total of 666.

The beast code of 666 comes from the Christian Bible in the book or chapter
titled Revelations that talks about figuring out what the beast is. If you 
paste in the english language which is more than 60,000 words you will find 
hundreds of 666 matches for some very "ordinary" words.

Note: Using the A=6, B=12, C=18 and so on to the end of the alphabet "formula" 
the word "computer" adds up to 666 which is the beast code value from Revelations.
